Humans
Originally from Earth, Humans are descendants of the ape family and in the course of their planetary existence got bogged down in wars with themselves several times. Nevertheless, they managed to rise to an interstellar race and to leave their home planet, which in the meantime has become invulnerable to them . Its preferred habitats are regions with a temperate or warm climate and a gravity of around 9.81 m / sÂ².
