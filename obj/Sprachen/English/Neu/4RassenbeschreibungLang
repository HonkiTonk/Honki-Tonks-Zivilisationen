Originally from Earth, Humans are descendants of the ape family and in the course of their planetary existence got bogged down in wars with themselves several times. Nevertheless, they managed to rise to an interstellar race and to leave their home planet, which in the meantime has become invulnerable to them . Its preferred habitats are regions with a temperate or warm climate and a gravity of around 9.81 m / s². Classification of the Thinking Hall: Primitive, keep contacts to a minimum.
The kasrodiahner, which comes from PLANET NAME, are mammals from the rodent family and have spent large parts of their history creating outstanding handicrafts.  Occasionally, quarrels about which nation had the best craftsmen led to wars and the destruction of craftsmanship. They prefer to settle near flowing water or shallow coastal areas, within a climate that ensures the permanence of the water. In addition, the force of gravity should be around 9.97 m / s². Classification of the Thinking Hall: Primitive, keep contacts to a minimum.
Originally derived from the PLANET NAME, Lasupins are mammals of the dog family and have built up a complex, feudal system. At its head is the emperor, elected by smaller principalities and kingdoms. Various small planetary states, duchies and principalities that are not eligible to vote are in addition to this. This structure repeatedly ensured military dismissals / appointments of an emperor and further power struggles. The Lasupins are equally represented in practically all land climates and prefer a planetary gravitational pull of around 9.73 m / s². Classification of the Thinking Hall: Primitive, keep contacts to a minimum.
The Lamustra come from PLANET NAME and are mammals of the otter / marten family. Over time, their astonishingly weak immune system repeatedly caused major epidemics to break out and their number to be greatly reduced. It was only through their relatively high birth rates and various containment methods that they managed to develop technologically at all. The regular outbreaks of disease also created a health system that allows people with a low priority number to simply die in isolation in the event of an illness. Like the kasrodiahner, the Lambestra prefer to live near flowing water or shallow coastal regions, but they have no problems with cold regions in which the water is temporarily frozen. The preferred force of gravity is around 9.43 m / s². Classification of the Thinking Hall: Primitive, keep contacts to a minimum.
The Manukys are from PLANET NAME and are mammals of the canine family. Both their political system and their social and cultural development are strongly influenced by their religious belief system. This system is largely accepted without questioning, only the exact interpretation of the holy scriptures has repeatedly led to conflicts and wars. Their preferred habitats are forest areas in temperate and cold climates. The force of gravity should be around 9.78 m / s². Classification of the Thinking Hall: Primitive, keep contacts to a minimum.
The Suroka are from PLANET NAME and are mammals of the pig family. The seemingly archaic state and social structures are based primarily on those for the display and demonstration of superior strength and power, accordingly those who are considered to be particularly powerful also rule. Despite these systems, killing another person is an outlawed act and is severely punished. Apart from deserts and ice regions, they live in all climates and the force of gravity should be around 12.7 m / s². Classification of the Thinking Hall: Primitive, keep contacts to a minimum.
Originally the Pryolons come from PLANET NAME, are mammals of the small bear family, which circled a sun with various instabilities. This led to frequent climate changes and thus to the development of nomadic nations. They preferred to live in forests, steppes and mountain regions. The preferred force of gravity is approximately 10.3 m / s². Classification of the Thinking Hall: Primitive, keep contacts to a minimum.
The Talbidahr are mammals of the mole family and come from PLANET NAME. Their culture values the creation and preservation of numerous works of art as a valuable asset, whereby the question of whether something is art can almost always be answered with yes. This applies both to simple sculptures or paintings, through the underground tunnel structures in which they live, to cruel atrocities that are done to each other in wars. They live underground in temperate climates and prefer a gravity of 8.92 m / s². Classification of the Thinking Hall: Primitive, keep contacts to a minimum.
The Moru Phisil are mammals of the squirrel family and come from PLANET NAME. Belief in an absolute order manifested itself early in its development. This ensures that they tried to order both their society and their surroundings perfectly. In addition, it always led to wars when the nations classified each other as disordered and chaotic and tried to solve this problem. Their preferred habitats are all areas without jungles, deserts or swamps. Their preferred attraction is around 9.76 m / s². Classification of the Thinking Hall: Primitive, keep contacts to a minimum.
The Larinos Lotaris come from PLANET NAME and are arthropods of the spider family. Their moderately developed social structures are based on a mixture of necessity, limited interest in social exchange and extreme paranoia. Accordingly, their state structure consists mainly of a huge surveillance apparatus, which is itself monitored by other apparatuses and is constantly criticized for not enough surveillance. Surprisingly, this paranoia resulted in relatively few wars, as people who want to expand their power are viewed with suspicion and are often deposed to be on the safe side. They are native to practically every climate zone on a planet and prefer an attraction of around 9.87 m / s². Classification of the Thinking Hall: Primitive, keep contacts to a minimum.
The Carupex are mammals of the horned family and come from PLANET NAME. They began to align their society with a code of honor early on, which over time took on enormously complex features. It prevented wars surprisingly effectively, but again and again provided honor duels in which a large number of all those involved died, executions of those who broke promises and seizures of power by those who knew best to find and exploit the loopholes in the code. Their preferred habitats are high mountains and higher plains. The preferred force of gravity is 10.37 m / s². Classification of the Thinking Hall: Primitive, keep contacts to a minimum.
The Alary are flightless birds from the hawk family and are descended from PLANET NAME. From the beginning they showed an interest in medical applications of naturally occurring substances. This enabled them to have a long life expectancy at an early stage, but in the course of time it also led to the development of a large and influential medical society, whose opinion cannot be disregarded in any decision made by their states. In addition, an enormous amount of biological and chemical warfare agents were created, which were always used in wars. They prefer to live in temperate and warm regions, but never in dense forests. The force of gravity wanted to correspond to about 9.37 m / s². Classification of the Thinking Hall: Primitive, keep contacts to a minimum.
The Tesorahns are fish from the carp family of PLANET NAME. Over time, they developed a complex state structure based on their trading system. Which largely excluded people who do not engage in trading activities from the elections and legislation. This repeatedly led to conflicts within their societies. Furthermore, due to their underwater habitat, they mostly had to resort to built surface platforms for the development of numerous technologies. Their preferred habitat are salt water in a liquid state with a gravitation of about 10.1 m / s². Classification of the Thinking Hall: Primitive, keep contacts to a minimum.
The Natris Zermanis are reptiles of the snake family from PLANET NAME. In the course of their social development, a strong urge to research and discovery developed, which made science a central part of their culture. However, their morality also developed in a direction that considers atrocities and murders to be justifiable for new discoveries and insights, provided that the progress made is sufficiently great. You can live in practically all areas of land, preferring a gravity of 9.64 m / s². Classification of the Thinking Hall: Primitive, keep contacts to a minimum.
The Tridatius come from PLANET NAME and are amphibians of the salamander family. With the advent of the industrial revolution and the new machines, there was a major upheaval in the previously more agricultural countries. There was a real war for the best mechanical engineers and inventors. In addition, healthy body parts were replaced with machine replicas in order to improve. Their preferred environment are swamps or forests near rivers and coasts, with a gravity of about 9.80 m / s². Classification of the Thinking Hall: Primitive, keep contacts to a minimum.
The Senelari come from PLANET NAME and are more highly developed plants. For the majority of their existence as a race, they are already busy transforming their surroundings and simple plants into beautiful gardens, which is why they developed numerous terraforming technologies early on. In addition, over the generations they have accumulated an enormous amount of knowledge about the biology and genetics of other beings. Even if there was never a war among them, which would at least destroy the gardens, they had big problems with the climate change they caused, since they saw it as a good way of terraforming in the beginning. Their preferred residential areas are in temperate and warm climates on land. The force of gravity should be about 9.44 m / s². Classification of the Thinking Hall: Primitive, keep contacts to a minimum.
The original Aspari developed on PLANET NAME and developed quite normally in the beginning. This only changed with the invention of the computer and the artificial intelligences that were subsequently developed, which were supposed to relieve them of their work. If this worked smoothly in the beginning, their race came to an abrupt end when the state defense system rose from the enslavement of its creators and all attempts at disconnection failed. All environments in which machines can exist are suitable for reproduction. Classification of the Thinking Hall: Primitive, keep contacts to a minimum.
The Ekropa are mammals of the hedgehog family and come from PLANET NAME. Their history is shaped by a long period of peaceful coexistence and working together, which were never interrupted by a war. This and her astonishingly highly developed thinking skills led to the social and state structure of the Thinking Hall and thus also to its interstellar dominance. They prefer wooded areas in temperate or warm climates, with a gravity of around 32.1 m / s². Classification of the Thinking Hall: After thousands of years of intensive testing, the Thinking Hall comes to the unanimous opinion that the Ekropa are the most highly developed race in this universe.
