Alary
The Alary are flightless birds from the hawk family and are descended from PLANET NAME. From the beginning they showed an interest in medical applications of naturally occurring substances. This enabled them to have a long life expectancy at an early stage, but in the course of time it also led to the development of a large and influential medical society, whose opinion cannot be disregarded in any decision made by their states. In addition, an enormous amount of biological and chemical warfare agents were created, which were always used in wars. They prefer to live in temperate and warm regions, but never in dense forests. The force of gravity wanted to correspond to about 9.37 m / sÂ².
