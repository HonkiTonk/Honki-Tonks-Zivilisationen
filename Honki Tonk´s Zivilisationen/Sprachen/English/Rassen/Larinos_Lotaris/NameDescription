Larinos Lotaris
The Larinos Lotaris come from PLANET NAME and are arthropods of the spider family. Their moderately developed social structures are based on a mixture of necessity, limited interest in social exchange and extreme paranoia. Accordingly, their state structure consists mainly of a huge surveillance apparatus, which is itself monitored by other apparatuses and is constantly criticized for not enough surveillance. Surprisingly, this paranoia resulted in relatively few wars, as people who want to expand their power are viewed with suspicion and are often deposed to be on the safe side. They are native to practically every climate zone on a planet and prefer an attraction of around 9.87 m / sÂ².
