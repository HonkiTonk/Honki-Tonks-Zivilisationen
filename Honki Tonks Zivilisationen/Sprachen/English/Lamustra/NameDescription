Lamustra
The Lamustra originate from PLANETENNAME and are mammals of the otter/marten family. Their astonishingly weak immune system repeatedly caused the outbreak of major epidemics and a severe decimation of their numbers over the course of time. Only through their relatively high birth rates and various containment methods did they manage to develop technologically at all. However, the regular outbreaks of disease also ensured the emergence of a health care system that simply allowed people with a low priority number to die in isolation if they became ill. Like the Kasrodiahners, the Lamzustra prefer to live near flowing waters or shallow coastal regions, although they have no problems with cold regions where the water is temporarily frozen. The preferred gravitational force is around 9.43 m/sÂ².
