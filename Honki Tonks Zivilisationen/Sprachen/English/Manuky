Manuky
The Manukys originate from PLANETENNAME and are mammals of the dog family. Their state system as well as their social and cultural development is strongly influenced by their religious belief system. This system is largely unquestioningly accepted, only the exact interpretation of the holy scriptures has repeatedly led to conflicts and wars. Their preferred habitats are forest areas in temperate and cold climates. Gravity should be around 9.78 m/s².
