Lasupin
Originally from the PLANET NAME, the Lasupin are mammals of the canine family and have built a complex feudal system. At its head is the emperor, elected by smaller principalities and kingdoms. In addition, there are various small planetary states, duchies and non-elective principalities. This structure has repeatedly led to the warlike depositions/appointments of an emperor and further power struggles. The Lasupin are equally represented in practically all land climates and prefer a planetary gravitational pull of around 9.73 m/sÂ².
