Lasupin
Originally derived from the PLANET NAME, Lasupins are mammals of the dog family and have built up a complex, feudal system. At its head is the emperor, elected by smaller principalities and kingdoms. Various small planetary states, duchies and principalities that are not eligible to vote are in addition to this. This structure repeatedly ensured military dismissals / appointments of an emperor and further power struggles. The Lasupins are equally represented in practically all land climates and prefer a planetary gravitational pull of around 9.73 m / sÂ².
