Larinos Lotaris
The Larinos Lotaris are from PLANETENNAME and are arthropods of the spider family. Their moderately developed social structures are based on a mixture of necessity, limited interest in social exchange and extreme paranoia. Accordingly, their state structure consists mainly of a huge surveillance apparatus, which itself is monitored by other apparatuses and is constantly criticised for not monitoring enough. Surprisingly, however, this paranoia has led to relatively few wars, as people who want to expand their power are eyed with suspicion and even deposed to be on the safe side. They are at home in practically all climatic zones of a planet and prefer an attraction of about 9.87 m/sÂ².
