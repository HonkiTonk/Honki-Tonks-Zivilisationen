Carupex
The Carupexians are mammals of the hornbearer family and come from PLANETENNAME. Early on, they began to base their society on a code of honour, which over time became enormously complex. It was amazingly effective in preventing wars, but always resulted in duels of honour in which a large number of all involved died, executions of those who broke their promises, and seizures of power by those who knew best how to find and exploit the loopholes in the code. Their preferred habitats are high mountains and higher plains. Their preferred gravity is 10.37 m/sÂ².
