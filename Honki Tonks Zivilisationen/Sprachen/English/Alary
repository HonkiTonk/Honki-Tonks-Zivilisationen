Alary
The Alary are flightless birds of the falcon family and originated from PLANETENNAME. From the beginning they showed an interest in medicinal applications of substances found in nature. This enabled them to live long lives from an early age, but also led in time to the emergence of an extensive and influential medical society whose opinion cannot be disregarded in any decision their states make. It also gave rise to an enormous amount of biological and chemical warfare agents, which were always used in wars. They prefer to live in temperate and warm regions, but never in dense forests. The force of gravity wanted to correspond to about 9.37 m/s².
