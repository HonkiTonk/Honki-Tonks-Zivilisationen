Ekropa
The Ekropa are mammals of the hedgehog family and come from PLANETENNAME. Their history is marked by a long period of peaceful coexistence and common work, never interrupted by war. This and their astonishingly highly developed thinking abilities led to the social and governmental structure of the Think Hall and thus to their interstellar dominance. They prefer wooded areas in temperate or warm climates, with a gravity of about 32.1 m/sÂ².
