Talbidahr
The Talbidahr are mammals of the mole family and originate from PLANETENNAME. Their culture values the production and preservation of numerous works of art, and the question of whether something is art can almost always be answered in the affirmative. This applies to simple sculptures or paintings, to the underground tunnel structures they live in, to the cruel atrocities they inflict on each other in wars. They live underground in temperate climates and prefer a gravity of 8.92 m/sÂ².
