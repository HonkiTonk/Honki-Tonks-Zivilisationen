Pryolon
Originally, the Pryolons came from PLANETENNAME, mammals of the small bear family, which orbited a sun with various instabilities. This caused frequent climate changes and thus the development of nomadic nations. They preferred to live in forests, steppes and mountainous regions. The preferred gravity is about 10.3 m/sÂ².
