Humans
Originally from Earth, man is a descendant of the ape family and got bogged down in wars with himself several times in the course of his planetary existence. Nevertheless, he managed to ascend to an interstellar race and to leave his home planet, which has become uninhabitable for him in the meantime. Its preferred habitats are regions with a temperate or warm climate and a gravity of around 9.81 m/sÂ².
