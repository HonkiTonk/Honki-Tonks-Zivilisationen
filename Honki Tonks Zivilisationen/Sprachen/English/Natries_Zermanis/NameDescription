Natries Zermanis
The Natris Zermanis are reptiles of the snake family of PLANETENNAME. In the course of their social development, a strong urge for research and discovery developed, which made science a central part of their culture. However, their morals also evolved in a direction that considers atrocities and murder acceptable for new discoveries and knowledge, provided the progress gained is sufficiently great. They can live on practically all land areas, preferring a gravity of 9.64 m/sÂ².
