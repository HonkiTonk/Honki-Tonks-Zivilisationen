Carupex
The Carupex are mammals of the horned family and come from PLANET NAME. They began to align their society with a code of honor early on, which over time took on enormously complex features. It prevented wars surprisingly effectively, but again and again provided honor duels in which a large number of all those involved died, executions of those who broke promises and seizures of power by those who knew best to find and exploit the loopholes in the code. Their preferred habitats are high mountains and higher plains. The preferred force of gravity is 10.37 m / sÂ².
