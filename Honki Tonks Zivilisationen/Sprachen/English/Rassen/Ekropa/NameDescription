Ekropa
The Ekropa are mammals of the hedgehog family and come from PLANET NAME. Their history is shaped by a long period of peaceful coexistence and working together, which were never interrupted by a war. This and her astonishingly highly developed thinking skills led to the social and state structure of the Thinking Hall and thus also to its interstellar dominance. They prefer wooded areas in temperate or warm climates, with a gravity of around 32.1 m / sÂ².
