Senelari
The Senelari come from PLANET NAME and are more highly developed plants. For the majority of their existence as a race, they are already busy transforming their surroundings and simple plants into beautiful gardens, which is why they developed numerous terraforming technologies early on. In addition, over the generations they have accumulated an enormous amount of knowledge about the biology and genetics of other beings. Even if there was never a war among them, which would at least destroy the gardens, they had big problems with the climate change they caused, since they saw it as a good way of terraforming in the beginning. Their preferred residential areas are in temperate and warm climates on land. The force of gravity should be about 9.44 m / sÂ².
