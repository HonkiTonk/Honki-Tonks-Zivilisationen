Lamustra
The Lamustra come from PLANET NAME and are mammals of the otter / marten family. Over time, their astonishingly weak immune system repeatedly caused major epidemics to break out and their number to be greatly reduced. It was only through their relatively high birth rates and various containment methods that they managed to develop technologically at all. The regular outbreaks of disease also created a health system that allows people with a low priority number to simply die in isolation in the event of an illness. Like the kasrodiahner, the Lambestra prefer to live near flowing water or shallow coastal regions, but they have no problems with cold regions in which the water is temporarily frozen. The preferred force of gravity is around 9.43 m / sÂ².
