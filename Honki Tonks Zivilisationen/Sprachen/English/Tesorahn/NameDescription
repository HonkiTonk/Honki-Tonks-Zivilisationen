Tesorahn
The Tesorahnians are fish from the carp family of PLANETENNAME. Over time, they developed a complex state structure based on their trading system. This excluded people who were not traders from elections and legislation on a large scale. This repeatedly led to conflicts within their societies. Furthermore, due to their underwater habitat, they mostly had to resort to built surface platforms for the development of numerous technologies. Their preferred habitat is saline waters in a liquid state with a gravity of about 10.1 m/sÂ².
