Senelari
The Senelari are from PLANETENNAME and are highly evolved plants. They have spent most of their existence as a race transforming the environment and simple plants into beautiful gardens, and have therefore developed numerous terraforming technologies early on. They also accumulated an enormous knowledge of biology and genetics of other beings over the generations. Even though there was never a war among them, which would destroy the gardens after all, they had big problems with the climate change they created, because they saw it as a good way of terraforming in the beginning. Their preferred habitats are in temperate and warm climates on land. Gravity should be about 9.44 m/sÂ².
