Aspari_2
The original Aspari evolved on PLANETENNAME and developed quite normally in the beginning. This only changed with the invention of the computer and the artificial intelligences that were then developed to do the work for them. While this worked smoothly in the beginning, it came to the abrupt end of their race when the state defence system rose from enslavement by its creators and all attempts to shut it down failed. All environments where machines can exist are suitable for reproduction.
