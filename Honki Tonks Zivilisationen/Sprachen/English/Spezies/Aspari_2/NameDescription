Aspari_2
The original Aspari developed on PLANET NAME and developed quite normally in the beginning. This only changed with the invention of the computer and the artificial intelligences that were subsequently developed, which were supposed to relieve them of their work. If this worked smoothly in the beginning, their race came to an abrupt end when the state defense system rose from the enslavement of its creators and all attempts at disconnection failed. All environments in which machines can exist are suitable for reproduction.
