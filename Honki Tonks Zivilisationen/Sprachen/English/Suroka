Suroka
The Suroka come from PLANETENNAME and are mammals of the pig family. The rather archaic state and social structures are based primarily on the display and demonstration of superior strength and power, and those who are considered particularly powerful rule accordingly. Despite these systems, killing another person is an outlawed act and is severely punished. They live in all climates, apart from deserts and icy regions, and the force of gravity should be around 12.7 m/s².
