Tridatus
The tridatus come from PLANETENNAME and are amphibians of the salamander family. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution and the new machines, there was a great upheaval in what had been more agricultural countries. There was a real war for the best machine builders and inventors. In addition, people began to replace healthy body parts with machine replicas in order to improve themselves. Their preferred environment is swamps or forests near rivers and coasts, with a gravity of about 9.80 m/sÂ².
